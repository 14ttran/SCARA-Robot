This script controls the robot Bot Ross to paint a given profile with a specified paint color. This script implements multiple tasks that repeatedly run asynchronously, but they are run so quickly that the mechanical system operates as if the tasks were being operated simultaneously. \hypertarget{index_Usage}{}\section{Usage}\label{index_Usage}
How to use\+: The script is already complete with all tasks set up. To use it, upload the code to the S\+T\+M32 microcontroller and plug in the motor pins to the appropriate locations. Then run the code and follow the instructions. \hypertarget{index_Testing}{}\section{Testing}\label{index_Testing}
This script was tested by providing a variety of profiles to draw and running the script to see the result. \hypertarget{index_Limitations}{}\section{Limitations}\label{index_Limitations}
If different hardware is used, or if the user desires to use different pins on the microcontroller, the script will have to be modified to accomodate the change. \hypertarget{index_Location}{}\section{Location}\label{index_Location}
